Visual Editor is a Rich Text editor for [Flutter] originally forked from [Flutter Quill]. The editor is built around the powerful [Quilljs Delta] document format originally developed by QuillJs. Delta documents can be easily converted to JSON, the encoding is easy to read and modify and offers many extensibility options.

**Why fork Flutter Quill?**

While building the [Visual Space] platform we begun using [Flutter Quill] to render text content for nextgen interactive tutorials and projects. However, we had to deal with issues such as severe lack of documentation, lack of automatic testing and lack of technical support from the maintainers. Therefore, we decided to fork Quill and improve it with additional features and a focus on higher quality standards.

## First contact

1. Clone the repository using "https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor.git"
2. Run flutter pub get and enable dart editor 
3. If you can't run the main.dart you have to change it with the one from example (example is used to run the demo app)
   -> edit configurations -> set the dart entrypoint with: C:\*your path*\visual-editor\example\lib\main.dart   
4. To push commits we have to ask the moderator to give you access

## How To Start

**Beta Testing**
The current version is not stable enough to be reliable and to be published in pub.dev. Until then you can try it out by linking directly from Github:

**pubspec.yaml**

```
dependencies:
  visual_editor:
    git: https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor.git
```

**Minimal example**

Make sure you don't overwrite the controller on `build()` or other updates, otherwise you will lose the contents of the history. Which means no more undo, redo with the previous states.
```dart
final _controller = EditorController.basic();
```

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    EditorToolbar.basic(
      controller: _controller,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        child: VisualEditor.basic(
          controller: _controller,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

**Saving a document**
```dart
final json = jsonEncode(_controller.document.toDelta().toJson());
```

**Retrieving a document**
```dart
const blogPost = jsonDecode(response);

final _controller = EditorController(
  document: DocumentM.fromJson(blogPost),
  selection: TextSelection.collapsed(offset: 0)
);
```

**Empty document**

When a document is empty a custom placeholder should be insert. An empty document looks like:
```json
[
  {
    "insert":"\n"
  }
] 
```
 
For convenience you can use a constant: `const EMPTY_DELTA_DOC_JSON = '[{"insert":"\\n"}]'`

**Delta or plain text**

Visual Editor uses [Delta] objects as an internal data format to describe the attributes of each fragment of text.

```dart
_controller.document.toDelta(); // Extract the deltas
_controller.document.toPlainText(); // Extract plain text
```

## Tips

* To have a more efficient search (CTRL + SHIFT + F) is recommended to exclude `/ios` and `/android` files from the search
   - rightClick on folder -> Mark as -> Excluded

Learn more about Visual Editor architecture and how to use the features.

- **[Editor (WIP)](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/editor/editor.md)** - Renders the document content as commanded by the `EditorController`.
- **[Editor Controller (WIP)](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/controller/editor-controller.md)** - Controls the editor, sync the toolbar, exposes useful callbacks.
- **[Documents (WIP)](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/documents/documents.md)** - Delta documents are used to store text edits and styling attributes.
- **[Toolbar (WIP)](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/toolbar/toolbar.md)** - Displays buttons used to edit the styling of the text.

## New Features
These features have been added since forking from Quill:

- **[Highlights](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/highlights/highlights.md)** - Highlights are temporary markings that can be displayed in the text editor without changing the underlying delta document. For example if you want to implement a search feature, you can use the highlights API to display the results and then remove them once the user exits the search text feature.
- **[Markers](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/markers/markers.md)** - Unlike highlights, the markers are permanently defined in the delta document. Several types of markers can be defined in the editor. Authors will be able to add them from the toolbar Markers dropdown. The editor can be configured to render some or all markers on demand. Markers are useful for labelling different areas of text for various purposes (introductory, reminder, needs review, etc).  

## Roadmap & Known Issues
